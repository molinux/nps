# üåê Net Promoter Score

### ‚ùì What a f*** is a Net Promoter Score?

O Net Promoter Score (or NPS) is a metric to measure customer satisfaction, 
through the calculation related votes to the question: 
"From 0 to 10, how much would you recommend our company ?"

Votes have a rating, which is taken into account, in this calculation:

| Vote | Classification |
| ---- | ----- |
De 0 a 6 | Detractor
De 7 a 8 | Passive
De 9 a 10 | Promoter

The classification notes are not consider on the NPS calculation.

The NPS formula is:

<code>(Promoter - Detractor) / Total of Avaliations</code>

<hr />

Through that application is possible to register
a user (who would be a costumer), create a survey,
list surveys, send emails to that costumers send 
their note and make the calculation of NPS.
